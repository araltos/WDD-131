			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The "To-Do List Manager" helps users organize their daily tasks. Users can add, mark as complete, and delete tasks, with the ability to save their task list locally. The app makes task management simple and efficient.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This app is intended for anyone looking to organize their day-to-day activities, including students, professionals, and people managing personal projects.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>JavaScript will be used to make the To-Do List Manager interactive and functional. Users will be able to add new tasks through an input field, which will dynamically update the task list on the page. Each task will have a checkbox to mark it as complete, and the completed tasks will visually change to show their status. There will also be a delete button for each task, allowing users to remove tasks from the list. The entire list will be saved in the browser's local storage so that users can return to their tasks even after refreshing the page. JavaScript will handle the task addition, completion, and deletion, as well as manage how tasks are stored and displayed.</p>
